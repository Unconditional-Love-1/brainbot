# brainbot
this is meant to be a demo

this contains functional brainbot 1.0 code, some functions work, others do not works with ollama >mistral, gemma, and llama2

currently this is a limited version, scan works once, chat works, agent creation works, agent memory stores, it creates a higher intelligence file called brainbot.json.
future updates are expected, currently you can have an agent work on any LLM noted above, currently working on getting localai and other LLM's working, as well as distinct agent voice output and the crypto miner fully functioning so it "intelligently" mines crypto with the right LLM. There are plans to make the UI in Unreal Engine and have agents be interactive avatars in the enviroment, each with working output, currently this is a terminal to communicate and build agents and agent memory.

all files are in .txt, you will have to convert them to .py and put them in the corresponding locations for it to work. the location of the file names can be found at the top of the file.
